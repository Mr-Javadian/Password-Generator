1.Developer Passcode:
here you can set a manual passcode in case you want specific people can use this software.

2.Enter Serial Number 
here you can enter the serial number of your device to generate passwords based on it.
I used a simple multiply function for the (service and factory), but you can change it to any function you want. even you can use encrypting modules.

there are 4 buttons for :
1. verifying developer passcode
2. generating password based on the SN you entered 
3. one for copying service password
4. one for copying factory password
